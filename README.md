# EE695 Applied Machine Learning

This repository describes all the materials for EE 695 course. There are implementations of basic machine learning algorithms based on Titanic dataset:
1. Gradient descent
2. Decision tree
3. Artifical neural network
4. Support vector machine

# Dataset description
The titanic dataset gives the values of four categorical attributes for each of the 2201 people on board the Titanic when it struck an iceberg and sank. 
The attributes are social class (first class, second class, third class, crewmember), age (adult or child), sex, and whether or not the person survived.
