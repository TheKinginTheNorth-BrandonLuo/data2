## This project describes work for movie recommendation system.

Movie, as a creative industry of politics, economy and culture, has been an important part of people’s life. 
With the development of Machine Learning, many different movie recommendation systems appeared. 
They make recommendations to people based on the data of both users’ history record and movies’ information. Users could find more movies they may be interested in automatically, and movie makers could using such a system to attract people watching more movies. 
In this project, our team aim to build a movie recommendation system based on three different methods – Decision Tree, K-means clustering, K- nearest neighbor. 
The system could determines whether a movie will be recommended to the user or not, and for a certain movie, recommend 10 or more similar movies.
